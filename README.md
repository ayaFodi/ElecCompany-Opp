# ElecCompany - Store Network Management System. 

# Overview:

ElecCompany is a C++ project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage a store network that sells computer-related products. The system handles various types of electronic items, including computers, mice, keyboards, webcams, and peripheral devices.

The primary goal of this project is to simulate a network of stores, where each store can manage its inventory of computer products. The system supports adding, removing, and managing items in each store's inventory while ensuring proper functionality and scalability for future products.

# Features:

Object-Oriented Design: The project uses core OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to create a modular and maintainable system.

Product Management: Includes various product types such as computers, mice, keyboards, webcams, and other peripherals, each represented by their respective classes.

Inventory Tracking: Each store in the network maintains an inventory, allowing for the addition, removal, and management of product items.

Error Handling: Custom exceptions are used to handle errors, ensuring robust and reliable operation of the system.
